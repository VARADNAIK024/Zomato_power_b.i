ðŸš€ Excited to Share My Latest Project: Zomato Sales Data Analysis! ðŸ“Š

Iâ€™ve been working on an exciting data analysis project where I explored Zomatoâ€™s sales data to uncover valuable insights on city performance, user behavior, and operational efficiency. Using tools like Excel, Power BI, GitHub, and Canva, I was able to:
âœ… Analyze sales and order trends across cities
âœ… Identify top-performing users and key menu preferences
âœ… Visualize key metrics and track growth with interactive dashboards
âœ… Design visually compelling reports for effective communication
âœ… Used DAX & KPI's for interactive dashboard
 
I leveraged Power BI to create dynamic dashboards, Excel for initial data cleanup and aggregation, and GitHub for version control and collaboration. For the final presentation, I used Canva to design clean and professional reports.

This project has been a fantastic opportunity to enhance my skills in data visualization, business intelligence, and collaborative tools. Excited to continue applying these learnings in future projects! ðŸ’¡ðŸ“ˆ
